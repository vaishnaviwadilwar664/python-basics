        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "    -  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes.\n",
        "    - These objects can contain data (attributes or properties) and functions (called methods) that operate on the data.\n",
        "    - Core components of opp is:\n",
        "            Class\n",
        "            Object\n",
        "            Polymorphism\n",
        "            Abstraction\n",
        "            Inheritance\n",
        "            Enclapsulation\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "    - A class in Python is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "    - It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "    - class keyword defines a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - __ init __ is a constructor method that gets called when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - self refers to the current instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Methods are functions defined inside the class.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "    - An object is an instance of a class.\n",
        "    - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), objects represent real-world entities and contains Data (attributes/properties) and Behavior (methods/functions).\n",
        "    - If a class is the blueprint, then an object is the house built from that blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "    - Abstraction hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features.\n",
        "    - Abstraction purpose is to simplify the interface for the user.\n",
        "    - Goal of Abstraction is hiding complexity.\n",
        "    - Encapsulation hides the internal data and restricts direct access to it.\n",
        "    - Encapsulation purpose is to protect the data and maintain control.\n",
        "    - Goal of Encapsulation is data hiding and protection.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "    - Dunder methods , also called magic methods, are special predefined methods in Python that start and end with double underscores, like       __ init __, __ str __, __ len __, etc.\n",
        "    - They are used to define how your custom objects behave with built-in Python operations — like printing, comparing, adding, indexing, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "    - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP where one class (child/subclass) can inherit the properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) of another class (parent/superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "    - It promotes code reusability, extensibility, and maintainability.\n",
        "    - Inheritance allows a class to acquire the fields and methods of another class.\n",
        "    \n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism means \"many forms\".\n",
        "    - In OOP, it refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same function or method in different ways.\n",
        "    - Polymorphism achieved in Python through method overriding and dynamic typing.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "    - Encapsulation is the concept of hiding internal object details and restricting direct access to some components. It allows controlled access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - In Python, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers like , public , private and protected.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "    - A constructor in Python is the __ init __( ) method used to set up an object with its initial values when it is created.\n",
        "    - It is automatically called when an object is created from a class.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "    - Class Method operates on the class, not instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Has access to class variables using cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Defined with the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "    - Static menthod does not access class (cls) or instance (self) data.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Used for utility/helper functions inside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Defined with the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "    - Method Overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different number or types of parameters.\n",
        "    - Python does not support function/method signature overloading like Java/C++.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - If you define a method multiple times with the same name in a class, the last one will override the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - Method Overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming where a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "    - The @property decorator in Python is used to convert a method into a read-only attribute.\n",
        "    - It allows encapsulation by letting you access methods like attributes, while hiding the implementation details.\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "    - Polymorphism is a core principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows different objects to be treated through the same interface, even though they may behave differently.\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    - An abstract class is a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "    - It cannot be instantiated on its own and is used to define common structure (methods or properties) that must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "    - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides a structured and modular approach to software design, making it easier to build and maintain complex applications.\n",
        "    -\tReusability : Classes and objects can be reused in other programs using inheritance. This avoids code duplication.\n",
        "    - Clear structure:Code reflects real-world entities, making it easier to understand and relate to.\n",
        "    \n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - Class variable:\n",
        "    - Defined in\tInside the class, outside any method\n",
        "    - Memory Usage  Stored once for the entire class.\n",
        "    - Belongs to\tThe class itself.\n",
        "    - Shared by\tAll instances of the class.\n",
        "    - Modified by\tChanging it affects all instances.\n",
        "  - Instance variable:\n",
        "    - Defined in Inside a method (usually __ init __) using self.\n",
        "    - Belongs to Individual objects (instances).\n",
        "    - Shared by Unique for each object.\n",
        "    - Modified by Changing it affects only that object.\n",
        "    - Memory Usage Stored separately for each instance\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "    - Multiple Inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "    - This means the child class gets access to the attributes and methods of all its parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of \"__ str __' and ' __ repr __\" methods in Python?\n",
        "  - __ str __:\n",
        "     - Readable string for users.\n",
        "     - Called by the print() function and str() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Returns a user-friendly string representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Meant for readability.\n",
        "  - __ repr __:\n",
        "     - Unambiguous string for developers.\n",
        "     - Called by the interpreter and repr() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Returns a developer-friendly string, ideally something that can recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Meant for debugging.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super( )'  function in Python?\n",
        "    - The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (super) class.\n",
        "    - It plays a vital role in inheritance, especially in method overriding and multiple inheritance scenarios.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __ del __ method in Python?\n",
        "    - The __del__ method in Python is a special (dunder) method known as a destructor.\n",
        "    - It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically during garbage collection.\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - @staticmethod:\n",
        "     - Doesn't take self or cls as a parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Behaves like a regular function, but belongs to the class namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Can be called on the class or instance.\n",
        "  - @classmethod:\n",
        "      - Takes cls as the first argument (refers to the class, not an object).\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Can access/modify class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Useful for creating alternative constructors.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "    - With inheritance, polymorphism allows a child class to provide its own version of a method defined in the parent class.\n",
        "    - So you can write common code that works for any subclass.\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "    - Method chaining is a programming technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, one after the other.\n",
        "    - Each method returns self, i.e., the current object.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - This lets you call another method immediately on the result.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __ call __ method in Python?\n",
        "    - The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n",
        "    - When you define a __ call __( ) method in a class, you can use object-name followed by parentheses ( ) to invoke that method — as if the object itself is a function."
