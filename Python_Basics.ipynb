        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "      - Python is a high level interpreted language.\n",
        "      - Python was created by Guido van rossum in 1991 while watching the movie monty python.\n",
        "      - It is popular for its simplicity,versatability, readabilityand ease of learning.\n",
        "      - This is widely used in data industry.\n",
        "      - It has lots of libraries and has huge active community.\n",
        "      - It is used for the automation, image processing, etc.\n",
        "      \n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "      - In python Interpreter is the program that translate your code into machine understandable language.\n",
        "      - Interpreter execute the code step by step.\n",
        "      - The debugging in the python is easy because it execute code step by step.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "      - Pre-defined keywords are the reserved words which has the special meaning in the Python.\n",
        "      - this keywords are cannot be used as the identifier/variable name/ function name.\n",
        "      - keywords are case sensitive.\n",
        "      - Pre-defined keywords example are, if,while,for,def,try,break,continue,false,true,etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "      - No, Keywords are cannot be used as the variable name.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "      - Mutability means the changing,updating the values/elements of the object.\n",
        "      \n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "      - Lists stores and also manage, update,change the elements of object, so they are mutable.\n",
        "      - Tuples are only stores the elements means once the object is stored we cannot change their elements,so they are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "      - In python \"==\" operator is called the assignment operator(double equal to). This is used to compare the values of the objets.\n",
        "      - ex.\n",
        "            a=[1,2,3]\n",

        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "      - Logical operators are the operators which are used to combine conditional statements.\n",
        "      - following are the logical operators in python-\n",
        "            Logical AND              //and\n",

        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "      - In python type casting is the changing the data type to another data type.\n",
        "      - This is also known as type conversion.\n",
        "      - Python uses the build in functions for type casting like int(),float(),str(),etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "      - implicit type casting is done by the computer because python understands the type automatically.\n",
        "      - explicit type casting means we have to give the command explicitly for changing type.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "      - In python conditional statements are used to make decisions based on certain conditions.\n",
        "      - following are the conditional statements -\n",

        "                    block of code\n",
        "\n",
        "      - elif statement is came when the if statement is not getting fulfill.\n",
        "      - when the elif statement condition is true then the block of elif statement will run.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "      - for loop are used for iterating over a sequence of elements.\n",
        "      - while loop are execute repeatadely in a loop while the certain condition is not met.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "      - while loop is used when the number of iteration is not known in advance like password verification.\n",
